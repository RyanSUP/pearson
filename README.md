# Pearson Assessment
## by Ryan Morici  

The goal of this assessment was to create a number line with 2 draggable nodes. The range between the nodes should be bold and the nodes should snap to the nearest tick.

## Steps and resources :

Since JQuery was allowed, I researched [JQuery slider widget](https://api.jqueryui.com/slider/) and used that as a starting point.

[This stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10224856/jquery-ui-slider-labels-under-slider) was helpful for learning how to label the slider and create tickmarks.

## Final thoughts :
The labels and ticks are slightly off, given more time I'd like to correct that. I would also position the labels and ticks in their own container in an attempt to avoid using absolute positions since that gets messy when trying to style elements around it.

It would be neat to write functionality that builds numberlines of any range.
